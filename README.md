# Registration Form

## Purpose

Build a survey form similar to [freecodecamp.org](https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/)

## What I learnt

Building and styling basic html forms.

I had trouble with the background-image where it would disappear when applying both ```background: no-repeat``` and ```background-size: cover```. This was resolved with the following code block

```css
background: url() no-repeat;
background-size: cover;
```

## Reflection

Initially struggled around the styling not so much the form functionality. But discovered, that actually styling forms is relatively simple.

I especially liked making all the input boxes the same width, which was done by adding a class to all the ```<input>``` elements as well as the ```<textarea>``` and ```<button>``` elements. This made the form look more uniformed.

Also centreing the form by applying ```margin: 0 auto;``` to the entire form resulted in a good look.
